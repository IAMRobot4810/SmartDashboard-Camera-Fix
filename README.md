To use, extract into your user directory, which is usually C:\Users\<username>\ This should place a .jar file in C:\Users\<username>\SmartDashboard\extensions\ (there's probably already a SmartDashboard folder in there, so it'll merge with it). Then restart SmartDashboard, and add the "USB Webcam Viewer (Compat)" widget
